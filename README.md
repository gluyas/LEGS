# LEGS Prototype

Archive of the LEGS prototype sources, including commit history. Many commits will appear empty as the game's art assets and various other files have been removed from all source revisions. Licensed under MIT license.

Playable builds available here: https://github.com/gluyas/LEGS/releases/tag/v1.0. The MIT License only applies to the code in this repository and does not include these builds or any of their contents.  
To build from source, one must provide their own copy of the InControl plugin for Unity, and their own art and sound assets. However, many individual components may be adapted to function without them.

Developed and submitted as a group project for MDDN343: Advanced Game Design at VUW, 2018.
